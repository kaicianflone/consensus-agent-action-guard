# Why consensus-agent-action-guard Improves AI Decision Quality

## Meta reasoning: stack alignment

`consensus-tools -> consensus-interact -> persona-generator -> agent-action-guard`

This skill governs the final mile: high-risk agent actions before execution.

## Why this skill improves behavior

1. **Pre-execution governance**  
   Risky actions are evaluated before irreversible effects occur.

2. **Action-class policy mapping**  
   Weighted consensus maps to ALLOW/BLOCK/REQUIRE_REWRITE.

3. **Irreversibility control**  
   High-risk destructive actions can be blocked or require human confirmation.

4. **Consistency across automation**  
   Different agents/actions share one governance standard.

5. **Accountability receipts**  
   Decision artifacts record rationale for every gated action.

## Self-improvement role

Autonomous systems improve when action quality is constrained by explicit policy and feedback, not post-hoc regret.

## Integration metadata

- **Prerequisite**: consensus-interact board workflow + persona_set
- **State substrate**: consensus-tools decision/persona artifacts
- **Primary output**: action decision artifact + updated persona set
- **Primary benefit**: safer autonomous execution under clear governance
